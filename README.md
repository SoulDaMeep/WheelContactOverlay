Commonly Asked Questions:
- Why does the 3D wheel overlay lag behind or is stuttery?
    Your framerate doesnt match the framerate at which it is drawn.
    Framerates that give smooth output: 30, 60, 120 . . .
  
- Why doesnt it work in online games?
    Being able to see which wheel that is currently making contact
    could be used to determine if the user has gotten a flip reset
    which could be against TOS as that could give a competitive
    advantage.
